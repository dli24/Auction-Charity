#### Motivation
Before building this app, I was only obsess in the auction part of the app where people compete to product or service. After that, when I was planning deeper, I was thinking that this app is too plain, so I would like to add an charity to this app, so there could be a better purpose to this app and also could make me look like a great person.

#### CHALLENGE
EVERYTHING IS A CHALLENGE!!!!and I am proud of every code I made.
